Transcript 03

P: [Provider name] meeting with [Client name] on 5/20.
C: one guy who hired me and paid me, said he was going to Europe Mack. So.
P: so, I brought you a new book
C: yea
P: they told me that you lost your book
C: I'm on the red one though.
P: no, you're on the last book.
C: oh. This is the one
P: yea the green one is the last one and last week. 
C: ohh that hurts so bad
P: What is going on with that ankle, before I go on?
C: I poured some hydrogen peroxide on there and I took a couple of Advil. I bought Advil again.
P: has it been helping that though?
C: yea, yea
P: now what is Dr. [name] say? When he comes?
C: when the last time I saw him, he didn't have time to see me. I know [laugh]
P: and what did they say? That they were going to put you on the list for next week?
C: umm no uh uhh what was I saying again. Eric 
P: okay
C: told me a few seconds ago or so uhh that they were going to call me for two weeks and I was going to see a guy, a specialist 
P: for the leg?
C: yea
P: good. So, Eric already looked at it today? 
C: umm yea
P: okay good, because I was going to send out another… 
C: I don't know if he looked at it but he 
P: he knows that. Well I know he knows what’s going on
C: oh yea.
P: but he is here so if need be before he leaves we will have him take a look at it you know. But he is on top of making sure he gets with Dr. Tan and updates that referral
C: uhuhh
P: so, we can get you in to get seen. Cause it has been too ongoing.
C: yea
P: I know you want to get that addressed and taken care of. And you are a very independent, mobile lady 
C: uhuh yea
P: so, we don’t want that to stop you from being able to go out 
C: yea
P: and do the things you want to do and still be active. Alright?
C: yea. Okay.
P: so, let’s make an agenda for today. Last week you went over session 3, which was considering all solutions. You had some at home practice, which was kind of like problem-solving work sheet. Umm and kind of gives you an idea of hay if there is an issue, if there is a problem going on 
C: need to consider
P: yup. That's where you were last week. Right? Yea I believe. So, we will review this, and we will begin with our new session which is session 4 putting it all together
C: ahh
P: and then we will go over at home practice and see if there is anything else that you will like to talk about this week. Is there anything you would like to put on the agenda today? Ummm. Alright. So, let’s review last week. Last week you had considering all solutions, which was separating the considering the assess steps is not easy, when we consider solutions it is essential that we do not start to assess. So, you guys talked about "Hey when there is a problem or when something is going to happen or occur..."
C: uhuhh
P: " that you consider all things that can happen in a situation."
C: yea
P: you know you got a plan you just to me earlier today to go to the clubhouse to go pick up some food
C: yea
P: so, there is a situation, we are not saying its problematic one but it’s a situation
C: I still want... I still want to go to [address]. 
P: umm [residential facility] 
C: [residential facility] 
P: back to [residential facility], and that's one of your goals, to move back to you know that location
C: I was thinking of checking out myself by myself
P: well first. Well first. You can certainly can go check it out on your own.
C: yea
P: that perfectly fine
C: I don't know how to get there. Back to that how do I found out how to get there?
P: well we can certainly help you find the route. You know wanting to know that bus route is if it’s something you want to know.
C: yea. Yea
P: we can also call her and see if she will be having some openings anytime soon. We can help you get over there, because I know especially with that ankle it’s hard to get around, especially far places that you would want to and its pretty far from here.
C: yea
P: but we can certainly give her a call to see what is going on with that. Umm so there is another situation that you can you know be aware of you know in regard to putting it all together or considering all situations. Umm because when we are going through a situation, anything can happen, you know, there is many steps that were gonna end up having to take to solve the issue or that problem. You know.
C: yea
P: if your plan is to go over to the meeting place to get some food, we gotta consider everything.
C: yea
P: what if they don't show up, or what if there isn't enough time for me to get there or what if I get there and there is so many people there that I'm a little later than intended and I'm a little later.
C: yea
P: exactly. So that was considering all. So, this week we are putting it all together. Right?
C: yea
P: using the scale technique.
C: okay
P: so, if your plans have not been working they may need more details. When laying out a plan think through all the steps necessary, even the ones that seem obvious. You know, like going to the program, it’s pretty obvious and you’re already aware that I got a plan to go over there to get some food
C: yea
P: there we go
C: yea. Yea
P: write down each step and how you are going to accomplish it. So sometimes if things are a little bit discouraging or unfamiliar for you if you're going through the process of trying to solve a problem or trying to make sure that you can get through a situation that you can write down all the steps you may end up coming encounter with
C: yea
P: so that you're a little more prepared. So, if I do get there and it’s a little too late, what am I gonna do? Maybe I can talk to someone and see when it’s gonna be the next distribution or making sure that even if I’m a little too late am I gonna be able to make sure I can get you know distributed you know food
C: uhuh
P: food like everyone else. Ummm also think about any resources that may be helpful to you when accomplishing each step. You gotta think resources aren't just paper and information I am a resource, [nurse name] as a nurse is a resource for medical needs, the clubhouse can be a resource for community needs, 411 is a resource. There are so many different resources that we have around us that you know when we're solving a situation we can use all of these things 
C: ohh
P: to help us get it done. Alright? Resources are things that are needed to execute the plan, including people for example your case managers, that's us, staff members, [name], other staff members here, friends or family members, objects, such as pencil, paper, telephone. Your telephone can be a resource like we were saying
C: yea
P: you can certainly call 411 if you had any questions or you were saying maybe if I knew the route I could go over to Rosie's by myself to go see it.
C: yea, yea
P: hey! 511 is a resource for the transit system. So, you can call 511 and you can say " hey, I’m here at El Cajon, this is my address, how do I get to [residential facility]?"
C: yea
P: and that resource will be able to help you with things like that. And like we were saying or even transportation, like a ride or a bus for that. So now we are going to lay out detailed steps. Did you or can you think of a time that you had a plan to do something um and it didn’t work out the way you wanted it to?
C: uhhhmmm well ummm. Staying out in places. No there aren’t really anything, no 
P: no? 
C: no
P: well I’ll give you an example. Ummm let’s see, so say for instance I had a plan to come and see you and you weren't here and it was the only plan I had for the day. What could have I done? Let’s see. Luckily
C: talk to Debbie [laughter]
P: talk to [name], first and foremost. Certainly, something I can have in mind that says hey if I had a piece of paper and my plan is to go see [name], so now I have gotten here, and I have realized [name] is not here. First things first, 
C: uhuh
P: talk to [name], ask [name]that she know where you at? Has she seen you? Does she possibly know where you went? Or what time you’re gonna be back?
C: yea
P: those are things that I can do to try to help refocus my plan or come up with a new plan since things were not working out the way I wanted to
C: yea
P: another example, say hey I went to the store to pick up a certain item and the item I am looking for just isn't there
C: yea
P: I can ask the clerk, to let me know when it will be in again or I can ask them where the nearest store from them is that I can get something similar to that item so having a plan, so we don't just go in... [client moans in pain] oh darling... Oh we don't just go in and think hey I'm gonna see [name], [name]isn't here and now I'm lost for words and I don't know what to do with myself. So now we're gonna review... [client moans in pain] oh sweetheart...
C: [laughter]
P:  the scale worksheet, sometimes plans don't work out because we miss some details. We want to be aware of all the details that come with the plans we are trying to accomplish. No problem. Use scale to solve problems with the steps and make a new plan, right?
P: so, on the second page, it gives us an example of what the scale worksheet looks like. [provider speaks to another client: not you today, but your team will be here soon, okay? Your team will be coming to see you something this week. You're welcome.] this is the scale problem solving worksheet, so... It’s kinda like the same worksheet you guys went over last week, it gives you an idea of how you can go about solving a problem.
C: uhuh
P: say you don't want to take too much time to stress yourself out and think about it internally, you've got some visuals that will help you be able to figure out how to get through the plan that you have. 
C: yea
P: so, the first box says for us to specify the problem. What’s the problem? Frame it as a question, be specific, so say the problem is your ankle, you know, and that is a problem.
C: I can think about asking the doctor for a stronger pain reliever or yea.
P: yea, because that is an issue that you are having you know right now in the moment. 
C: yea
P: so, its finding a way to get through that. Yea.
C: [moans in pain]
P: how has that ankle been affecting your ability to get up and do the things you want to do?
C: umm sometimes I just go lay down or if it’s really bad I do a foot soak.
P: yea, and sometimes
C: water, yea that really helps
P: that helps? Good. The cold water?
C: yea
P: not the warm, yea that’s good. Um and even if you got a bucket and you put some water in there and you can even probably ask it'll be you gotta get used to it but asking Debb or them for some ice too, to put it in with the water and it will make it really cold but I bet that will help with some of that pain.
C: okay
P: pain that you are having. Specially if you know that the cold water helps, making it a little bit colder might help a little more
C: [laughter]
P: helpful, you know, and when sometimes when we are in physical pain, that can also affect you know our mental and out thought process. How has the pain been affecting you know your mental and your thinking?
C: yea. I feel, like it, I feel like
P: your emotions
C: I feel like it’s hard to talk
P: yea and certainly, sometimes when we are having pain it effects our ability to respond appropriately to others 
C: yea
P: sometimes you are more easily bothered or annoyed
C: mhmm
P: because of the pain you are having. You know so, it’s really important that Doctor [name] can find ways to better address some those physical health needs and concerns that you are having and not letting them go ongoing without addressing them, you know, because no one should have to be having that much pain
C: yea.
P: so that can certainly can be a problem that you are having. You know the amount of pain in my ankle, or the fact that it’s been unaddressed by the doctor or its taking so long,
C: yea
P: and maybe that's the question. " hey why is it taking so long to address my physical health needs and my physical pain needs? You know"
C: yea
P: you know. So, then we want to the second box on the left, um gives us and the right gives us six options for consider all possible solutions. We are going to brainstorm alternative just generate, don't evaluate. So were gonna consider all possible solutions. So, if our concern and our question is that why I am having so much physical pain or why is it taking so long to address my physical pain umm possible solutions can be one again addressing it with doctor tan
C: uhuhh
P: maybe 2, asking Debb to help advocate your concerns and the pain that you are having to doctor Tan. 
C: yea
P: 3, you have already done so by you said now you are taking some Advil, that’s helping with the pain
C: yea, mhmm, 
P: did you buy the Advil yourself? 
C: yea
P: Did you let [name] know that you bought yourself some Advil?
C: uhmm I think she heard me say, yea.
P: okay. So yea letting her know so that she is aware that along with the other medications you are taking, that you are now taking some Advil and letting Doctor [name] know that hey, because it is going so far beyond being address, I am having to do things myself
C: yea the psychiatrist she said that use Advil.
P: so, you've got a doctor notice and that is one of the possible solutions you are having. Its finding alternative medications that can help with the pain. 4 what you said, soaking your foot in cold water, because that's a possible solution
C: keeping it clean
P: keeping it clean, yea... 6, following up with healthcare appointments when they are made.
C: yea
P: so, you know those are all possible solutions to this issue of why am I having so much physical pain that you can manage? Right? So, then our next two boxes, one and two, our third section is gonna let us know how we can assess the best solution. We are gonna pick two you like and identify positive and negative of each, right? So, we're gonna, out of the six possible solutions, you know to whatever the problem is, you are going to pick the two most likely ones that you can use. So, you've let me know that hey, soaking it in cold water is a useful solution that you have already been using,
C: yea
P: a lot. So maybe that's one of the best solutions we can think of. And another best practice solution may be just better communication with [name], to help her advocate.
C: ohhh [moans in pain]
P: oh darling, how often are you having to take the Advil?
C: umm well a little every day.
P: okay. And how many each setting?
C: maybe four.
P: okay
C: oh no. Two each time. 
P: okay two each time. Yea is it a lot of sharp pain in there?
C: yea.
P: yea. Possibly when we leave from here, so you don't have to walk far, if you’re still wanting to go over to the clubhouse, I can drop you off over there. And you can just sit over there until umm they start handing out food.
C: alright. Yea
P: so, you know you don't have walk over there, and just it would be getting home
C: yea. Yea okay
P: okay, yea. We will pick two of the best solutions that you think, and we can think about some good things about that solution and some bad things about that solution, because we don't know exactly what will and will not work
C: yea, maybe I take the wrong thing to [laughter]
P: that's a possible con to it, like you said, like hey I am deciding to make other medications, but the negative part may be hey maybe it’s not the right medication for me
C: there was, I went through a lot of that where I took a pill and I had the flu, where I rolled back, I guess it must have been from the flu where I kept throwing up, 
P: and you know that's one of those cons. You know if medication is one of the best solutions, and you're having negative side effects, your throwing up, you know
C: that went away though, oh gosh
P: yea, that's a good thing. Those are things you would put in that area
C: yea
P: but then we got some pros
C: pros
P: because maybe with the medication, it is helpful.
C: yea, yea
P: or you know it decreases the amount of pain you are having, or it allows you to get up and be more mobile
C: yea, yea
P: more mobile that you can than when you are in much more pain, you know, so that's what you would put under those pros and cons is your picking what two of what you think would be the best possible solutions to the problem that you are having and you think of some good things about why you are picking that solutions and that you are also making yourself aware of that hey, maybe if it doesn't work, these are some of the negatives that can come from them.
C: uhuh, yea
P: then we are gonna lay out a plan, we are gonna select one of the two solutions, now we came up with 6 at first, right? Because we are giving ourselves all of these options. 
C: yea
P: we've got a problem, we're giving ourselves multiple options to pick from, and then we are going to decrease those options because we can't do them all, right?
C: uhuh
P: we broke it down to two. We're thinking of the good and the bad, hopefully one has more good than bad, and then we pick that one and we work with that one first. Right? 
C: yea
P: so, if we say that hey better communication with the doctor is going to be my first best plan of action. 
C: mhmm
P: so, I am gonna let [name] know what is going on and i am gonna hope that she is going to advocate my concerns to the doctor 
C: yea
P: and umm hopes that we can come up with a good solution. Right? So then after we lay it out with our one best practice solution, we're gonna rate ourselves. So, over this next week you are going to think of a plan think of some solutions, break it down to two, then break it down to one possible solution that you are going to use or one uhmm best plan to help problem solve that problem. And they you are going to scale yourself to see if it worked or if it didn't.
C: yea, yea
P: you know, so maybe our decision, our final decision will be to talk to Debb, and for her to help us advocate our concerns to Doctor [name],
C: yea, yea
P: and then we wait for Doctor [name] to come back next week
C: uhuh
P: and then we will see if that will helpful or not. Did it help us our success rate more with Debby's assistance or did it make it just the same or? 
C: yea
P: and there wasn't much of a difference.
C: yea, yea
P: and then you're gonna evaluate yourself and give a brief explanation of why you think that was helpful or not helpful and then we will try it again.
C: okay.
P: alright? What’s on your mind?
C: uhmm going over to program
P: going over to program. How often have you been going over to program?
C: uhmm whenever I can, until I start getting used to the Advil and I start saying I better go and take some Advil.
P: yea having some pain
C: yea it’s obvious.
P: yea and that's what we were saying. Sometimes that pain can be a mental break, or you know and when you have these ideas that you want to be active and do things in the community
C: oh, guess what?
P: what's that?
C: I went to church on Sunday and I went with [name]
P: uhuh
C: he went with me, when service was over we fell asleep and people when I woke up people were already leaving [laughter]
P: [laughter] 
C: he woke up and and he said can I go with you again next Sunday?
P: at least you were there, that's what’s important you know?
C: yea it's it’s within walking distance,
P: well that's good.
C: yea yea
P: that's really good
C: it’s nice, all the churches have been mostly within walking distance
P: uhuh, well that's a good thing. Especially if you know that is something important to you and something you want to keep a connection with, it’s good that you do that
C: yea, yea
P: how often are you putting up that foot and elevating it?
C: uhmm every day I think
P: yea, that'll go a long way
C: yea, I sit up and read sometimes
P: that will go a long way
C: I read, and read a book and yea "Vengeance"
P: oh? Is it a good book? 
C: yea
P: interesting? A good story?
C: yea, its fiction
P: ahhh, something to keep you busy. That is a good thing though. That's a good thing. How have you been doing with the medication stuff?
C: okay. 
P: good
C: owwww
P: ohh
C: [laughter]
P: any concerns or side effects about the medication?
C: umm no
P: okay, good. That's good thing. Keep that you know line of communication open with us. Day of the doctor and all, so that we can be aware of what is going on.
C: yea
P: with your meds or any concerns about that
C: alright, alright
P: I will certainly continue to elevate that, soak that, and be asking for ice from [name], even if you don't put the ice in your bucket, getting a bag of ice and just sitting it on your leg and letting it you know
C: uh I think I am satisfied with the cold water
P: well whatever works best for you, and then elevating it a little bit after that cold soak.
C: yea
P: alright. Is there anything that you need to get out of your room or anywhere before I take you to the clubhouse?
C: no
P: you ready to go?
C: yea
P: alright I will get you over to the car, and you can get ready for some food
C: alright, I’m gonna put this away
P: okay you can put that away in your room, so you don't lose it. And then I will meet you out back here.
