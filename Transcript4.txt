Transcript 04
P: [date] session [provider name] and [client name] were doing the first session in the problem-solving module in our work book.
P: Hi [Name]
C: Hi, what’s up?
P: how you doing?
C: good
P: good, glad to hear that
C: just kicking back, taking an easy day
P: Nice!
C: yea
P: relaxing a little bit
C: yea
P: so, we are on the green book now.
C: okay
P: which is problem solving skills module consumer workbook
C: okay
P: so, we are gonna set an agenda. So, we are gonna review you’re at home practice, we are gonna learn problem solving skills, which is the acronym SCALE.
C: yea
P:  we are gonna do some at home practice. Do you want to add anything to the agenda?
C: no, there is no time
P: okay great. Let’s look at your blue book, at you’re at home practice. 
C: is it this? At home practice...
P: so, we are gonna go all the way to the back, I think you finished this book, is that right?
C: maybe, I think so. 
P: okay. So, the at home practice was expressing negative feelings. Is that right?
C: yea
P: okay. So, the at home practice was expressing negative feelings. 
C: yea
P: how did you do on that?
C: umm, well we were working on the goal to maybe talk to doctor at program about how I can make the chest pain go away
P: uhuh
C:and I talked to him the other day last week I think it was
P: uhuh
C: and he said that that on a scale of 1 to 10 how how... Um last week my homework was to talk to him about that
P: okay
C: about the chest pain
P: okay. To express negative feelings to him.
C: right yea.
P: so how did that go?
C: good. He said umm the usually with chest pain if it’s so bad that you are heaving and stuff, you know like bending over and stuff, he didn’t say much about it.
P: okay so can you give me an example of how maybe you expressed what negative feeling you expressed to him
C: well, well I told him that umm I had chest pain and I’m wondering if there is anything you can do to make it go away.
P: mhmm
C: umm he didn’t really say much
P: he didn’t. So how do you feel like he responded to your expression
C: not so, not so good.
P: not so good
C: yea
P: okay. Alright. Do you think maybe it could have been expressed in a different way or do you think you did a good job of expressing it?
C: I think I did a good job of expressing it,
P: uhuh, and it just wasn't received how you would have liked to be received
C: yea, yea
P: how would you have liked it to be received?
C: idk, give me a new medication or something
P: uhuh.
C: because it hurts, it hurts right now
P: it hurts right now.
C: yea
P: yea. Do you want to tell me about that pain?
C: it just hurts to inhale, and it hurts to exhale, to breath
P: okay, okay
C: yea
P: okay. Are you having trouble breathing?
C: not really, it just hurts
P: okay. It just hurts
C: yea
P: do you think its anxiety a little bit?
C: idk i've had an ekg a couple of weeks ago and I have had a couple of those done and they just say chronic chest pain
P: okay okay
C: that's all they ever say
P: okay, okay. I wonder if smoking has anything to do with the chest pain.
C: yea, that too and that's hard because I want to smoke
P: yea you like to smoke but it kind of gives you a little chest pain
C: yea, yae
P: oh, what a tossup huh?
C: yea
P: [laughter] alright.
P: so, let’s go through that at home practice, because I don’t, I see that you didn’t write anything, but it sounds like you did your homework
C: yea, yea
P: so, before you did that, how did you think you were going to do?
C: I thought maybe I would get a better response
P: okay so on a scale of 0 to 10 ten being I'm gonna succeed and do great and 0 being I’m i’ll do bad and fail,
C: right
P: where did you think it would be
C: 7 or 8, 
P: okay
C:7
P: okay okay and then you went umm you communicated that and then how did you think it did how do you think how you did on a scale of 0 to 10?
C: uhhhmm maybe a 9
P: so, you you are very confident in your ability to express your negative feelings.
C: yea, yeea
P: okay, okay. And so, do you think you could have done anything to improve?
C: uhmm no maybe if I talked to the nurse next time
P: okay good.
C: yea
P: good good. And how did you say it to the doctor, just out of curiosity
C: well is aid you well I have chest pain, is there anything I can do to make it go away?
P: mhm
C: and he didn’t say much
P: mhmm
P: yea 
C: so
P: well yea, good sounds like you are expressing yourself [name]
C: yea
P: how do you feel about that?
C: good, I feel confident
P: good, that's good to hear
C: yea
P: okay so we are gonna look at the first page on here.
C: the green one?
P: uhuh. And we are gonna look about, gonna look at problem solving with SCALE. Have you ever heard of SCALE before?
C: no, never
P: okay so it should be interesting
C: yea
P: alright, so problem solving steps spell out SCALE. Like your efforts to scale the mountain. The mountain being your problem, your challenge, your goal and kind of what steps. So, S stands for specify, what is the problem, you're gonna frame it as a question, not make it too big, you're gonna make it specific and it’s an important step in achieving your goals that you can accomplish by next week, okay?
C: yea
P: okay
C: okay
P: The C stands for consider all possible solutions. So, you are gonna brainstorm all the possible alternatives, and you're not gonna evaluate them, that's gonna be the next step
C: yea
P: so, then assess the best solution, identify positive and negative to each alternative and you're gonna pick the best one. 
C: okay
P: then you are gonna lay out a plan. What are you gonna do first second, third. Who will do what, how, when, what you're gonna need, time support people, transportation, money, okay and finally you are going to execute and evaluate. Did the plan work? How well did it work? Can it be improved? Do you maybe need to try a different solution? And then you are going to use scale, to solve your problems and challenges that come up.
C: okay
P: sounds like a mouthful.
C: yea it’s a lot
P: does this sound like a lot?
C: yea
P: how so?
C: it’s just like a lot of words.
P: a lot of words and a lot of information. And I think that’s why they made it as an acronym of SCALE, so you can use at specify, consider, assess, lay out a plan, and then execute and evaluate
C: yea
P: and it kind of shortens it a little bit
C: okay
P: what do you think?
C: sounds pretty good
P: sounds good. Does it still sound like a lot?
C: yea
P: [laughter [. Well do you think looking at an example would help?
C: sure
P: okay, let’s look at the next page, there is an example on the next page
P: so, in this example, they're discussing a problem, so they say specify. To define the problem and be specific. So, what’s the problem. Do you want to read what the problem is right there?
C: consider
P: you're gonna read this right here.
C: oh, how can I remember to take my medication at bed time?
P: okay. So that's the issue, that's the problem. How can I remember to take my medications at bed time? So then after we specify what the problem is we are gonna move on to consider. We are gonna look at all possible solutions, and brainstorm possible alternatives. So, do you want to read these bullet points right here, on how they are considering it?
C: my roommate can help me to remember, write note to stick on bathroom mirror, refrigerator etc. Have my brother call me every night. Place the medicine bottles next to my toothbrush, relabel and color code bottles, use a pill box.
P: okay. So those are all possible solutions that this person could come up with to try and remember how to take medications at bed time. 
C: yea
P: so then in assessing the best solution you pick two solutions that you like the most and you identify the positives and negatives of each. So, this person said, one solution would be to write notes and stick them around the house. 
C: yea
P: okay. So, the positive to that would that I don’t need to rely on anyone else and I’m most likely to see one of them
C: yea
P: okay. And the negatives is that, some notes may fall off. And then another solution is that they picked is to put the medication next to my toothbrush. And they looked at positives of that, I don’t need to rely on anyone else and the negative was I may forget to brush my teeth or there are a lot of things there and that you may not notice them. 
C: yea
P: right? 
C: yea
P: so, which out of those two was the best solution for them?
C: umm. The note, the number 1, writing notes. 
P: yea! Why?
C: because it’s a good way to remember.
P: absolutely. And also, there is a couple of more positives than negatives on that one.
C: yea, yea
P: right?
C: yea
P: so, their assessment was that I think I’m gonna write notes and stick them around the house.
C: yea
P: so then, next step is a plan
C: okay
P: alright. So, they are gonna look at what am I gonna do first, second and third. So, I need to get a pen and post it notes, umm looking at where I get them and maybe I need to use SCALE again to figure out how to get the post it notes, right?
C: yea, yea
P: then after I get the notes, I’m gonna write the notes
C: okay
P: and then I’m gonna stick them to the bathroom mirror and around the house
C: yea
P: so, there is just three steps to make it simpler
C: yea
P: okay and then, in execute and evaluate you are gonna look at did my plan work? How well did my plan work? Can it be improved. Right? And just kind a look at all the things what went wrong and how can I fix that and maybe I would have to use another solution if it didn't work
C: yea
P: okay. So how does that sound to you?
C: pretty good. It’s still a lot of words but...
P: it is.
C: but it sounds pretty good
P: does that clarify it a little bit
C: yea
P: when we use an example?
C: yea.
P: it does? 
C: yea
P: how so?
C: well now I know what it means
P: okay. 
C: when you ask the question
P: so now it’s not just words, but you are implementing it. 
C: yea
P: is that right?
C: what does implement mean?
P: implement means putting it into practice
C: okay
P: okay, so I know something and now I’m going to put it into practice in my life or use it
C: oaky
P: right? Once I know scale I will be able to use it in my life
C: yea.
P: does that make sense?
C: yea
P: a little bit?
P: yea
P: okay. Alright. So, let’s look at a session summary.
C: is it gonna be on this page?
P: it’s gonna be on the bottom right there. 
C: okay. 
P: I like how you are following along
C: oh, thank you.
P: that's awesome
C: 
P: so, with scale that we just talked about specify, consider, assess, lay out a plan and execute and evaluate. So, what does scale stand for?
C: scale. Specify, consider, assess the best solution, lay out a plan, execute and evaluate
P: awesome!
C: yea
P: yea!!
C: cool
P: you want to say it one more time? So we can try to remember. 
C: specify, consider, assess the best solution, lay out a plan, execute and evaluate
P: yea
C: so, we are going to specify, consider, assess the best solution, lay out a plan, execute and evaluate
C: yea
P: cool! SCALE.
C: scale 
P: easy to remember huh?
C: yea I just still need to read it though
P: that’s ok. That’s how we remember and learn
C: okay yea
P: so those steps. Those are 5 steps to simplify and solve problems and challenges. To take steps to achieving our goal. Right?
C: yea
P: so that’s gonna be you’re at home practice. So, you have scale problem solving worksheet right here. And see how it maps it out for you. So, it gives you boxes to specify the problem, brainstorm or to consider all possible solutions, pick 2 of those and identify positives and negatives to each, lay out a plan and execute and evaluate.
C: yea
P: okay. So, what do you think what problem are you going to specify for your practice?
C: that maybe I can talk to doctor again and see what he says and see if I can get a second opinion.
P: okay. So, are you thinking of speaking to another doctor?
C: well. Maybe if there is another doctor around at program.
P: uhuh
C: umm. Maybe I can ask the same doctor again the same question and see if he has anything else
P: sure, that’s a possibility. Do you think that that would be effective for you?
C: maybe so.
P: yea? 
C: yea
P: okay. So, let’s look at actually specifying the problem and then we can consider different solutions and alternatives
C: yea
P: so, what’s the problem that you are specifying?
C: I am trying to get more information so that I can have so I can make the chest pain go away
P: so, the problem is that you have chest pain
C: yea
P: so how can I make the chest pain go away?
C: maybe the doctor, since he is a doctor has more information about something like that
P: okay. Oh my gosh [name] you are moving on to the possible solutions
C: yea
P: yea. So, consider all possible solutions, right?
C: yea
P: so, one would be that maybe the doctor knows or ask the doctor. Right?
C: yea
P: what's another thing you can do? Or another solution?
C: talk to the nurses at program
P: okay. Talk to the nurses
C: yea
P: what’s another one?
C: ummm talk to you guys and [team name] and Dr. [name] psychiatrist?
P: sure, sure.
C: yea
P: what’s another one. And we don’t have to implement these but or use them we just can what could possibly be any solution. Right? So what's another one? Other than...
C: pray about it to god
P: okay
C: and like trust the lord to take care of me.
P: sure.
C: cause I’m a Christian and I believe in the bible
P: yea. So that’s definitely a possible solution
C: yea
P: okay. And what is another one? Sounds like you are on a roll.
C: talk to my family
P: okay. What do you think they could do about that?
C: idk, pray for me
P: yea. Okay. And what’s another one?
C: umm, well I used to go to [hospital name] doctor’s appointment.
P: mhmm
C: in san Diego by [address], and Dr [name] was my doctor and so I don’t I haven’t seen him in years, so maybe get a second opinion from another doctor
P: sure. So, you're looking at talking to the doctors right, another possible solution will be to talk to the nurses
C: yea
P: another possible one would be to talk to god. Another one you mentioned is ask your family. Can you think of one more?
C: well uhhhmm [engine roaring, drowns out participant response completely]
P: we really got our brains working, don’t we? [laughter] awesome! Okay so um one of them may be that you are not willing to do but it’s still a solution is to maybe quit smoking.
C: yea
P: right? But and that is good for consider all possible solutions because we are not we are just considering them, right? We are not doing them. We are just writing them down. 
C: yea
P: so then for assess, cause that’s A. 
C: yea
P: right? We are gonna pick 2 of those and we are still not gonna do anything with them, we are just picking them
C: okay
P: okay so out of your out of those possible solutions what two would you like to consider and assess?
C: talk to doctor again maybe he has more information 
P: mhmmm
C: maybe let’s try it again with him
P: mhmm
C: and the second one is talk to the nurses
P: okay. Okay. Okay. So, then what you would do would be to write the pros and the cons. So what would be some pros of talking to the doctor?
C: pros are a good thing?
P: uhuh. Pros are positive yea
C: umm maybe he has something else to say about my chest pain.
P: okay.
C: or if I got a new guy or [name] or the nurse I don’t really know
P: okay so were looking at possible positives of talking to the doctor, so we are making it really specific.
C: yea
P: okay
C: okay
P: so, you are thinking a possible pro of talking to the doctor would be that he would give you an alternative explanation
C: yea
P: okay. Alright. What’s another pro?
C: ummm I can check if he is right with whatever he has to say.
P: okay. So, you can listen to him. Okay
C: yea
P: okay. Alright. And um what’s another positive?
C: I don’t know. 
P: yea
C: I don’t know. 
P: that’s enough okay. 
C: yea
P: you know you don’t have to have all the answers, this is just an exercise to look at possible solutions, right?
C: yea
P: so, what would be a negative of talking to the doctor again?
C: maybe he is not he can’t give me the information that I want to hear
P: mhmm
P: sure. That’s a negative. What’s another negative?
C: maybe the cause is the because I smoke cigarettes and if I don’t want to quit,
P: sure,
C: you know
P: sure
C: I know I should at least cut back, but it’s hard for me, cause people here smoke and I have been smoking for years? Do you smoke?
C: yea
P: were talking about
C: me
P: about you, yea
C: okay
P: yea why is that important to you if I smoke?
C: oh no I don’t care
P: mhmm
C: I just think it’s funny
P: it’s funny. Well you know what I understand
C: yea
P: I can tell you that. That I..
C: its none on of my business, I’m sorry.
P: you know what it's okay. You are allowed to ask whatever you want
C: okay
P: you know but I do understand where you are coming from, but there are significant health risks
C: yea
P: and you know when you are experiencing chest pain, then that’s something do I want to continue the behavior that is creating problems for me is kind of where I am hearing you are at
C: yea
P: is that I get, I am getting, I have chest pains, but I’m still smoking because I want to and its hard.
C: yea
P: does that sound accurate?
C: yea
P: okay so let’s get back to this. So, what would be some pros of talking to the nurse?
C: well maybe they have something to say that can help me out
P: mhmm
C: maybe another alternative that I haven’t talked to them about
P: so, they could help you brainstorm
C: yea
P: and what’s a con of talking to the nurse
C: they won’t be able to say anything that means anything
P: mhmm. Mhmm. So, they won’t be able to help you
C: yea
P: how you want to be helped
C: right
P: and so, after so then you are going to lay out a plan. 
C: yea
P: I am kind of helping you with you at home practice, but you'll be able to write it out later
C: yea
P: but I think it helps to clear it up a little bit
C: yea
P: does it?
C: yea
P: okay so in laying out a plan you are gonna select which of these solutions work for you. So, you picked out of your solutions or your assessments you picked, talking to the doctor, talking to the nurse
C: yea
P: so, which one of those would you want to use?
C: talking to the doctor
P: okay. So, what is the first step? In that plan? 
C: just talk to him and be open and honest about my feelings
P: sure
C: and see what he has to say
P: sure. Sure. Absolutely
C: yea
P: and with this model in the plan we are looking at all the little details that make it possible for us to implement that and to be successful. Right?
C: yea
P: so, the first step, just the thought and tell me what you think about this would be to get the doctor
C: yea
P: right?
C: yea
P: cause before I can talk to him I need to get there and that would be step one maybe
C: but he is usually there when I have programs and sometimes I see him
P: so, when you go to your day treatment?
C: yea
P: first step would be maybe, how would you approach him at day treatment?
C: well I would say hi [name], and I have I have been having a lot of chest pain and what would you suggest helping it go away?
P: wow,
C: yea
P: that is awesome!
C: yea thanks
P: look at you are speaking up for yourself [name]
C: thanks
P: good for you! How do you feel about that?
C: I feel pretty positive
P: looks like it, I can see it on your smile
C: yea, thanks
P: alright
C: that’s a nice tattoo
P: thank you
C: I have a tattoo of a [name] on my back, it’s about that big
P: awesome
C: yea
P: okay. How do you think you are going to succeed?
C: I feel pretty positive umm maybe an 8 or a 9.
P: okay. Feeling pretty positive about your plan
C: yea
P: okay, well [name] will be really interested in hearing about this.
C: yea, maybe tomorrow after I see the doctor I can keep you keep you up on what happens
P: absolutely, yea call us at the office, call whoever is on duty and let us know how it worked out for you
C: okay
P: mhmm. How do you feel about this?
C: I feel pretty positive
P: you do? Okay. Alright
C: yea
P: because I know it sounded like a mouthful before and like a lot of words, right?
C: yea
P: did breaking down help a little bit?
C: yes
P: okay. Okay. So, do we remember what scale stands for?
C: [laugh] well if I look. Do you want me to look?
P: absolutely
C: okay. Specify, consider, assess best possible solutions, lay out a plan, execute and evaluate.
P: yup. So, do you how do you feel about being able to write this out on your own?
C: like this week?
P: yea
C: maybe I can do that
P: yea!! Do you think it would be helpful for you?
C: yea
P: as appose to trying to remember it all?
C: yea
P: okay and you didn’t want to add anything to the agenda
C: yea
P: umm so how was this session for you?
C: good, positive
P: it was positive. Okay. How so?
C: I feel more confident about talking to the doctor and the nurses
P: okay
C: we will see, I go to program tomorrow, we'll see what happens
P: okay sure
C: yea
P: and how was it, how was I? How was this with you with me? Would you prefer that I did anything different?
C: no, everything was fine.
P: okay
C: alright
P: any other feedback?
C: just remember to talk to the doctor when I see him
P: alright. Would it help if you wrote this out before hand? Maybe brought it with you?
C: I can do that. It would be easy
P: yea. Yea. Think about it
C: okay
P: well okay [name] thank you so much.
C: you're welcome. Thank you for your time
P: thank you.
