Transcript 06
P: Today is [date]. I'm here with [name] and we're going to start section 2. Okay, so let's see. So, let's review. So, the first thing we want to do is we want to, um, look at the agenda. So, starting on page 6 we have our agenda. Um, we're going to review the at-home practice that you completed, so that's awesome. Good job. Good job. Um, were going to go over the 3Cs - catch it, check it, change it. Um, and then we'll do some stuff on catch it - recognizing automatic unhelpful thoughts - and then we'll, um, look into some at-home practice. So, first, let's go back to your at-home practice on page 5. And, um, it was about identifying thoughts.
C: uh hum
P: right? And so we wanted, what it was asking you to do is write down one of your thoughts and whether you think it was helpful or unhelpful. So, we want to...so let's start with number 1.
C: okay
P: so, the first thought says example. Nobody would want to be my friend. Is that a helpful or unhelpful thought?
C: unhelpful.
P: how did you decide if that is helpful or unhelpful. What is in that thought.
C: it says nobody.
P: it says nobody, right? Good. Good. Good. Good. So, how can we change it from an unhelpful thought into a helpful thought.
C: changing the, the, um, the [unintelligible]
P: okay, right? Changing the nobody. What will we change it to?
C: [unintelligible]
P: so, instead of saying nobody we could say...
C: everybody...
P: everybody.
C: ...wants to be my friend.
P: sure. Everybody wants to have a friend. That would be a helpful. Right. Awesome job. Good job good job. Um, and then, let's see, number 1. So, I’m going to have you read what you wrote. 
C: I have to finish my project.
P: I have to finish my project. 
C: uh huh
P: okay. And was that a helpful or unhelpful. 
C: helpful
P: helpful. Okay. And what did, and, let's talk about what would make it a helpful.
C: that I have, that I’m doing something positive.
P: that you're doing something positive, right? Right? Good. Good. Good. Good. And then, let's see, number 2.
C: I don't want to take a shower.
P: I don't want to take a shower. 
C: uh huh
P: okay and is that a helpful or unhelpful.
C: unhelpful.
P: unhelpful. What, and, how can we change it to make it a helpful.
C: uh, I’m thinking the...instead of don't, I want.
P: I want to, or I will.
C: I will take a shower.
P: right?
C: uh uh
P: so, just by changing that one word in that sentence, right? Will change it from a helpful to, or from an unhelpful to a helpful. Good. Good. Good. Good. And then we had the option on number 3. Let's like like you did it. That's awesome. Overachiever.
C: I want to go with my daughter to, I want to go to the store with my daughter.
P: okay. Is that a helpful or unhelpful?
C: helpful
P: a helpful. Good. So, you had two helpful thoughts, um, over this past time and then on unhelpful and we can see how we can make that a helpful. Awesome. Good job on your homework, too, by the way. Okay, so let's start by reading the 3c's. It's catch it, check it, change it. Okay? So, let's see. Go ahead and read it for me.
C: where? Right here?
P: yep.
C: I don't how to read. The primary skill we will be using to change our thinking is the 3c's.
P: uh hum
C: catch it, check it, check it, change it. 
P: yep.
C: what's it.
P: what's it? Right? Because if you're going to check it, what is, what is it mean? So that's what it's going to tell you. Okay. Let's go.
C: is the thought might be accurate or a mistake.
P: yep
C: changing mistakes in thinking is, is skill that takes practice. Like learning to ride a bike.
P: yep. So, what is that saying to us? What does that mean? What do you think it means? That a thought that may be accurate or a mistake. It's kind of like the helpful or unhelpful. Isn't it?
C: uh huh
P: yeah
C: I don't know how to explain it.
P: that's okay. Let's, let's work it through. So, just like the, the helpful or unhelpful thoughts, right, and how we change something from a helpful to or from an unhelpful to a helpful. Um, those might be accurate or a mistake, right? If it's helpful, it's accurate. If it's unhelpful it's, uh...
C: a mistake
P: a mistake, right? So, by changing the mistakes in thinking or changing our unhelpful thoughts takes time. It takes practice to that. And that's what you're going to learn. It's like learning to right a bike. You don't just get on it and ride it. Like think about your grandsons. Right? When they started to learn to ride a bike. Right? They were ahhhhh, swoosh, crash. They get back on then ahhhh, crash. Right? Okay. So, let's move on to the first one. 
C: the first C is to learn how to recognize and while and write down your thoughts.
P: yep
C: check if the thought is accurate or inaccurate, helpful or unhelpful
P: yup
C: the second C is to decide if the thought is accurate or unhelpful 
P: mhm
C: change it, change the mistake in thinking in to accurate helpful thoughts 
P: mhmm
C: if I thought, if I thought is accurate or unhelpful that the third C is to change it to an accurate, helpful thought that can help you feel better and to do things, Ashive?
P: achieve 
C: achieve your goals
P: awesome! So, when you say things like helpful and unhelpful can be the same as accurate or inaccurate 
C: mhmm
P: right? So that kind of interchange. So, if it is accurate and helpful those are, are those positive or negative? If something is helpful and accurate.
C: mhmm
P: is that positive or negative?
C: its positive
P: its positive
C: uhuh
P: right? So those are our positive thoughts, our helpful thoughts, our accurate thoughts
C: helpful mhmm
P: right? And if its inaccurate or unhelpful, those are our…
C: negative
P: negative thoughts, excellent job. Excellent job. So that’s how, that’s how you need to just decide, that's the check it right?
C: mhmm
P: just like if you check the mail, or when you check the stove when you are cooking, or you check on your grandsons when they're playing
C: mhmm
P: you have to decide what right?
C: mhmm
P: if they are doing okay? Or are they not doing okay? Is the food ready? Is it not ready? Those are all of the umm things we do every single day. 
C: mhmm
P: now if you go to check on your grandsons and they are fighting, or they are drawing on the walls, 
C: mhmm
P: you have to make a decision, you have to check 
C: mhmm
P: if what, right? Is it helpful or unhelpful? Is it accurate or inaccurate? Right?
C: mhmm
P: okay good. Did that make sense?
C: yes
P: okay so the last one change it. The changing it is similar to what we did or what you did, because you did your homework umm the at home practice right? Was it helpful or unhelpful? And then when we went back over it we you could recognize that changing just one word can change it from being helpful or unhelpful or accurate or inaccurate. And that's what the change it part is
C: mhmm
P: and you are already pretty good at that one, so that's excellent. Excellent. So, let’s move on to the next section, or not the next section but the next page number 7. And.... Uhh. I guess it's mine to read? Remember this, the three C's help you change your unhelpful thoughts and correct common mistakes in thinking that prevent you from achieving your goals and feeling better. It's remind you again, catch it, check it, change it. Right?
C: mhm
P: so, go ahead and start with the number, the catch it, so this is 
C: catch it, catch it
P: yup
C: catch it
P: catch it kchooo
C: catching an unhelpful thought: 
P: yup
C: here are some unhelpful thoughts. There is no point in trying, things will never, never get better. 
P: mhmm
C: I can't trust anyone
P: mhmm
C: people won’t like me because I have a mental illness, I can't change the way I am, I was born this way. I am too sick to do that, to do what I need to do or have fun.  
P: good, so these are pretty negative thoughts, right? Or they are unhelpful.
C: unhelpful, mhmm
P: you see how those are all unhelpful, they are all negative aren't they?
C: negative yea
P: so, let's have a discussion, what do you notice about all the thoughts above?
C: they're negative
P: they're negative. Right on, right on. Would these, would these thoughts help you reach your goals?
C: no
P: no? How come?
C: because they are negative
P: because they are negative right?
C: not positive mhmm
P: they're not positive. If you always thought I can’t trust anyone
C: mhm,
P: how would you
C: that’s negative
P: its negative right? And when you’re are now,
C: helpful
P: well when you are talking about anyone, that's, that would be everyone in your life
C: mhmm
P: the grocery store, the postman, your daughters, your grandsons, there is all these people in your life
C: mhmm
P: and if you have the thought that you can’t trust anyone right? That would go backwards, right?
C: mhmm unhelpful 
P: right, good job. Good job. Let’s go to the next one. Catch it.
C: catch it
P: using feelings as a red flag. 
C: feeling is an important signal to let us know to catch a thoughts, we should check our thoughts when we are having a negative feeling.
P: mhmm
C: like afraid, angry, sad, etc. Because a thought is linked to the feeling, the bad feeling is a red flag to check our thoughts
P: right? So when we are having a bad thought, because we have them every day, right?
C: mhmm
P: is that correct? Cause you know, we might be afraid
C: mhm
P: for you it would be like when you are in the car
C: mhm
P: you get afraid, and so when you think about that you caught the thought. I am afraid of being in the car because of other cars going to fast
C: mhmm
P: all the other reasons we have talked about in the past, you feel afraid of being in the car. You already caught the feeling, right? You've recognized the unhelpful thought, you've caught it, you catch it. 
C: mhmm
P: so now we wanna see how we can take that unhelpful or inaccurate thought and make it a positive
C: positive
P: okay? Remember this, bad feelings are red flags, when you are feeling a negative feeling as yourself what, went through my mind just before I had that feeling. So right before I was feeling afraid, what was happening?
C: negative
P: right? We needed to go in the car and go to TJ and I was scared of being in the car
C: mhmm
P: so, what was...
C: unhelpful
P: right? Session summery.
C: the three cs is the skill for changing inaccurate or unhelpful thoughts
P: mhmm
C: use feelings as red flags to tell you when to check your thoughts
P: okay, so that’s what we have for session number 2. So then now we have our at home practice, let’s go through this and see if maybe we can do the first one together
C: mhmm
P: and then you can do one on your own. Cause there is 2, 2 of them, so catch a thought and note the situation, feeling, and action linked to it. So, the situation. So, let's think of a situation that maybe happened, um, this last week. Um, what happened, where were you and when did it happen. Okay? So, let's think if there's something that happened, um...
C: okay. Like i’ve been dizzy.
P: you've been dizzy.
C: uh huh. Have been dizzy. Where was I when it happened. When it happened. In the kitchen.
P: you were in the kitchen?
C: what happened in the kitchen
P: uh hum
C: I was busy in the kitchen.
P: uh hum.
C: how was I feeling. Dizzy. What was I doing. Cooking.
P: you were cooking.
C: so, now catch it?
P: yup
C: is it negative?
P: well, what was I thinking in this situation?
C: what was I thinking?
P: uh hum
C: that I could feel.
P: that you could fall. Right?
C: what went through my mind? To be careful.
P: to be careful.
C: which thought best explains how...
P: which thought best explains how I was feeling.
C: okay. What was I doing?
P: uh hum. Because you've identified several feelings. Right? You were cooking. You were feeling dizzy.
C: uh hum.
P: you were afraid you were going to fall.
C: uh hum.
P: okay. So, which thought best explains how you were feeling?
C: afraid
P: afraid. Right?
C: uh hum
P: okay. Because I was dizzy, I got afraid I was going to fall. Okay, so how do we make that, um, into a positive. Into a... Or maybe...
C: I was feeling good.
P: uh hum
C: cooking in the kitchen.
P: uh hum. Is cooking a, something you enjoy doing?
C: [unintelligible]
P: do you enjoy cooking? Does it make you happy?
C: yes
P: okay. So, you were doing a positive behavior. Right? And a feeling, got a feeling of dizziness that caused you to be scared.
C: okay
P: um, and so what was the action you took? What did you do? What did you do when you started to feel dizzy or afraid?
C: I was slowing down.
P: you slowed down.
C: I was slowing down. 
P: uh hum. What is, explain, let's see. Can you give me an example of what slowing down means?
C: like trying not be afraid and going slow.
P: uh hum. Did you sit down? Did you lay down?
C: I laid down.
P: I laid down.
C: laid down.
P: okay and did that improve your, um, dizziness?
C: uh hum
P: it did. Okay, so, something that you managed and then did the fear go away?
C: yes
P: good. Good. Were you able to return to cooking?
C: uh hum
P: good. Good. Because that is something you enjoy doing.
C: yes
P: okay and then, um, did you feel dizzy any more while you were cooking? After you went back to cook?
C: no. After a while I feel better cause I went to lay down.
P: you laid down. Right. And then you, then you returned to cooking after that?
C: yeah
P: okay. And then, um, you didn't get dizzy again after that?
C: no
P: okay. Until today.
C: until today.
P: until today. Um, and, uh, what were you doing today when you got started to feel dizzy?
C: I started down the steps.
P: you were walking down the stairs?
C: down the stairs.
P: okay. Um, and then you got dizzy and what did you do, what action did you take?
C: I just stayed there standing.

P: 3 minutes okay okay until you stood on the stairs for three minutes
C: mhm
P: okay okay could you sit down on the steps?
C: no
P: no? You just stood still and just waited for it. Is it when you for example um when you have been laying down for a long time and you stand up really quick is that when you get dizzy?
C: no what right now it was before when I early started using the medication, now I know how to deal with that, now it’s not that kind of dizzy that kind of dizzy, is this kind of dizzy I'm walking and I feel dizzy.
