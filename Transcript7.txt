P: it’s been a while huh
C: yea
P: so how are you doing?
C: uh good, I left my phone charger at my friend’s house and she’s going to work 
P: huh
C: I have the key to her house, so I have to go get that before I go to school because my phone will die
P: okay
C: and then I have to go to school from 1:30 to 5:30 but I am late, I am late everything 
P: you said your late?
C: I am gonna be late for school
P: you're gonna be late for school 
C: yea cause I still have to pick up my charger, my phone dies my mom and brother, and everyone will freak out
P: how about we go to the other room
[moving noises]
P: I’m gonna turn on the light
C: yea its ok, my eyes are hurting a little bit, my eyes are very sensitive to sunlight too. Nobody believes me, but I have astigmatism in both eyes and double vision
C: I had this book at home that I started
P: we are running a little bit late today, so we are gonna catch up a ummmm  a little umm on the book
C: okay
P: umm well there is this form I wanted to talk to you about and then we have to get your things huh
C: yea
P: yea quarters in your food card
C: yea
P: is there anything that you want to talk about?
C: well I haven’t spoken to my friend name for like since my birthday
P: okay
C: there was an incident where I was at her house and she invited me to her house and she invited a guy there to bring food for her bring us food, me too I guess, he brought a lot
P: mhmm
C: he brought his dog
P: okay
C: and I guess he smacked the dog in front of me
P: ohuh
C: he didn’t do it once, he did it three times. It’s not hard, but the dogs just don’t understand what that means
P: yea
C: they don’t know why that is happening to them and I know a lot about animals
P: mhmm
C: and I said something, that’s probably not the best way to get her to calm down, let’s give her something to chew on or play with and she’s probably bored
P: right
C: and my friend told me that it was inappropriate of me to say something to her friend
P: hmm
C: so, I haven't spoken to her since, and we talked about it yesterday, she kept calling me and I wasn’t responding
P: yea
C: I just I don’t, and I think, and this is what I told her as much we have talked in the past she should know that I’m really touchy about animals and children because they are weak
P: mhmm
P: so that created a conflict in your friendship right there
C: I don’t think I like her as a person, but I knew that about her she is about, she has a weakness for guys, she dates all the time, she does all the dating stuff and I don't respect that 
P: so, let’s do this and we can talk about that
C: yea, but we talked about it, but that’s what I have been dealing with recently 
P: wow ok, and I know that you know for you you know you you have you have friends and you value friendship and I’m sure that’s something that has been on your mind

C: okay
P: so, before they meet with the doctor, they are going to have to do a computer assessment
C: mhmm

P: yea that’s good
C: what we’re doing is that for today,
P: yea that’s for today, what’s gonna happen is that all of this is gonna be on the computer
C: mhm
P: and what this is, this actually came from this lady name [name] she was diagnosed with schizophrenia when she was 17,
C: mhmm
P: she had a hard time communicating with her doctor
C: ohh
P: umm you know medication, symptom, she was in and out of hospitals all the time umm they told her she couldn't do anything, and she had to go home, and she was sedated on medications a lot
C: ohh
P: umm she was finally able to talk to her doctors about what right medications she would be on
C: ohh
P: and she was able to finally go to school, she ended up getting her PhD
C: that's awesome
P: and she started going to, you know she went to school for a really long time
C: awesome
P: she graduated really fast with her PhD, she created the program so that she would help other people communicate with their doctor, help them communicate with their doctor what medication you know medications what conversations, you know cause having these conversations can be sometimes hard
C: yea
P: but also, not just medications but also personal medicine 
C: mhm
P: medication is not everything, medication doesn’t, just being on medication is not what helps
C: yea
P: you know having other good things in your life is important, so that’s what she is advocating
C: mhmm
P: this program is going to be here, were going to have a small computer lab and were gonna start sometime in April
C: mmm
P: where there will be it’s like a 30 min assessment
C: mhmm
P: and we are gonna have someone help people umm on this assessment umm and its gonna have all kinds of videos, its actually really cool cause we had to do it ourselves
C: mhmm
P: umm it has all kinds of videos, it has questions about umm its gonna ask you [name] how often did you play with your cat since you last saw your doctor?
C: mhmm
P: its gonna say a lot, a little, somewhat, you know, and you get to pick umm
C: mhmm

C: okay
P: its gonna say how often did you take your Zyprexa in the last month?
C: mhmm
P: and you also get to pick from different options, were gonna generate a report
C: mhmm
P: your doctor, you and your doctor get to see this report
C: mhmm
P: umm and over time you can see you know
C: what’s the best
P: right, what’s the best, and will doing both things together work better and these can always change you know, let say you play with your cat today more, you don’t paint anymore, we can always change these
C: it’s just that I have a lot more things I do,
P: yea, so we can, I mean there is only three that would show up on the computer
C: yea, yea
P: but if you ever want to change them you can change them, it could vary, whatever you see on there the doctor is going to see on there
C: mhmm, okay
P: and it’s what I see, so there is nothing on there that its very transparent, whatever you know, there is not much more that I can see on there 
C: mhmm
P: well actually the only thing I can see on there that you can’t, is other peoples report
